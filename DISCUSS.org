* Technical issues
*** Section 1, "the search queries executed on Twitter are mostly not code mixed"
    [MM] Citation required. AFAIR, track overview paper for
    [MM] Mixed-script Information Retrieval made the opposite
    [MM] claim. @Ayan, confirm korte parbe please?
    [MM] This claim comes up again in Section 2.1, and seems to
    [MM] form the basis for query set construction method
    [MM] adopted.
*** Section 2.1, "Dictionary based Classification"
    [MM] Some estimate of classification accuracy should be
    [MM] provided. A small, manageable sample could be randomly selected
    [MM] and checked manually. The claim that the
    [MM] "percentage of code-mixed tweets is thus significant"
    [MM] assumes that the classifier is more or less accurate.
*** Section 3: 
    [MM] "... (from Table 1 it can be seen that the number of
    [MM] monolingual English documents is more than 10 times that
    [MM] of the number of code-mixed ones) ..."
    [MM] This is probably a serious weakness. Obvious question
    [MM] this point raises is: if this is clear from Table 1,
    [MM] then were the experiments really needed? We need to
    [MM] think a little more carefully about what point we are
    [MM] trying to make (and redesign the experiments if required).
*** Table 2:
    Retrievability score-gulo dekhe kamon khoTka lagchhe. 
    @Debasis, Single index, split index ar clustered index ki shob alada
    alada kore implement korechhile? Single ar split index clustered-er
    special case hishebe pawa uchit, noy? Na kichhu bhul bujhchhi? sheTa ki
    confirm kora jaay?


* Exposition
*** Section 1, How can code mixing affect IR?
    [MM] Motivation-ta arektu concrete korte parle bhalo
    [MM] (preferably with an example).
*** average document frequency (DF)
    [MM] If the definition given is correct, then this is a
    [MM] misleading term, since it suggests mean DF across terms.
    [MM] Also, a definition / citation needs to be provided for TTR.
*** Query set construction
    [MM] Following statistics may also be indicative, and should
    [MM] be reported: 
    [MM] - # of docs. in each collection containing at least 1
    [MM]   term from the intersection vocabulary
    [MM] - size of intersection vocabulary / total vocabulary for
    [MM]   each collection
*** Split index: $D \in \{ D_M, D_C \}$
